# Chapter 6 - Lab 2 - React + Node.js Project Deployment

This chapter guides you through the complete workflow of deploying a full-stack web application with a React front-end and Node.js back-end using Docker and Jenkins. You'll containerize each component, push images to Azure Container Registry, and automate deployment via a CI/CD pipeline secured behind a corporate VPN.

## Learning Objectives

- Containerize React and Node.js applications using Docker
- Push Docker images to Azure Container Registry (ACR)
- Automate build and deployment using Jenkins CI/CD pipeline
- Access internal services through VPN and configure Jenkins credentials

By the end of this chapter, youâ€™ll be able to deploy and manage containerized applications in a secure network environment with automated CI/CD practices.
