# Chapter 3: Containerization

This chapter introduces the fundamentals of containerization—what it is, why it's essential in cloud computing, and how it supports modern software development. You'll also explore common use cases, benefits, and the distinction between artifacts and artifact management tools like JFrog Artifactory.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand what containerization is and how it differs from virtualization
- Identify real-world use cases for containerized applications in the cloud
- Recognize the benefits of containers in terms of portability, scalability, and fault tolerance
- Differentiate between software artifacts and Artifactory as a repository tool


By the end of this chapter, you’ll be able to explain containerization, its role in modern application deployment, and how it enhances the development lifecycle through tools like Artifactory.
