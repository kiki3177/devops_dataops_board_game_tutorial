# Chapter 8 - Optional Lab 2 - React + Node.js + MongoDB Project Deployment


This chapter introduces full-stack application deployment with external services and modern DevOps workflows. You will integrate MongoDB Atlas into a Node.js backend, manage secrets securely, containerize both front-end and back-end applications using Docker, and automate deployment using Jenkins CI/CD pipelines and Azure Container Registry (ACR).

## Learning Objectives

- Set up and securely integrate external services such as Mapbox and MongoDB Atlas into a full-stack application
- Build and test a React + Node.js + MongoDB application locally using environment variables and real data
- Containerize front-end and back-end services separately using multi-stage Dockerfiles
- Push Docker images to Azure Container Registry (ACR) and automate deployment via Jenkins CI/CD pipeline 
- Configure GitHub webhooks and Jenkins pipelines to trigger builds and deployments automatically

By the end of this chapter, youâ€™ll have hands-on experience deploying a data-driven full-stack application with secure credentials, containerized environments, and automated CI/CD workflows suitable for cloud infrastructure.
