# Chapter 6 - Lab 2 - React + Node.js Project Deployment

This chapter introduces end-to-end deployment of a full-stack web application using industry-standard DevOps practices. You’ll begin by running a React + Node.js app locally, then containerize both components using Docker. After testing locally, you’ll deploy your containers using Jenkins pipelines and Azure Container Registry (ACR), simulating a real-world continuous deployment workflow. The lab concludes with a collaborative “buddy activity,” where you'll deploy a peer's application using your own pipeline setup.

## Learning Objectives

- Run and test a full-stack React + Node.js application locally in a development environment 
- Create and configure Dockerfiles to containerize both front-end and back-end services 
- Build and push Docker images to Azure Container Registry (ACR)
- Set up and automate deployment pipelines using Jenkins and GitHub webhooks 
- Collaborate with peers by deploying Docker images built by others using shared CI/CD pipelines

By the end of this chapter, you’ll have practical experience with containerization, CI/CD pipeline automation, and real-world team deployment workflows using Jenkins and ACR.
