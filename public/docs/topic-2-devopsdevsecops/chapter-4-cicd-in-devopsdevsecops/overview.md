# Chapter 4 - CI/CD in DevOps and DevSecOps

## Learning Objectives

This chapter builds on your prior understanding of CI/CD by focusing on how these practices evolve within DevSecOps—where security is integrated into every phase of the software delivery pipeline. You’ll explore how CI/CD pipelines automate the software delivery process and how integrating security testing within these pipelines helps detect vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle.

You'll gain clarity on the similarities and key differences between DevOps and DevSecOps pipelines, as well as the tools and strategies used to build secure, automated deployment systems.

## Learning Objectives

- Recap the core principles of CI/CD and their role in DevOps workflows
- Compare and contrast DevOps and DevSecOps CI/CD pipelines in terms of goals, practices, and toolchains
- Identify how security testing tools like SonarQube, Trivy, and ZAP are integrated into the CI/CD process
- Visualize and design secure CI/CD workflows that balance speed, quality, and security


By the end of this chapter, you’ll be able to articulate the importance of embedding security into CI/CD pipelines and describe how DevSecOps enhances traditional DevOps by making secure software delivery a continuous and automated process.
