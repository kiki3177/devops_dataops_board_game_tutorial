# Chapter 7 - Lab 3 - Secure A Vulnerable Application

This chapter guides you through the process of identifying, testing, and remediating common security vulnerabilities in a sample Node.js + Express web application. You will gain hands-on experience applying secure coding practices and integrating automated security testing into a DevSecOps pipeline. This lab reinforces the importance of “shifting left” by embedding security earlier in the development lifecycle.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand and exploit common web application vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Path Traversal.

- Implement secure coding techniques to remediate identified vulnerabilities using parameterized queries, input validation, and output sanitization.

- Automate security testing using Jenkins, SonarQube, and custom security unit tests to ensure vulnerabilities are caught during CI/CD.


By the end of this chapter, you’ll be able to identify insecure code patterns, fix vulnerabilities using secure development practices, and configure a secure CI/CD pipeline that integrates static and dynamic application security testing tools.
