- Learn the key components and flow of a Jenkins-based CI/CD pipeline
- Explore best practices for building scalable, secure, and observable CI/CD workflows using Jenkins

By the end of this chapter, you’ll be able to explain how Jenkins automates code delivery processes and articulate how CI/CD enhances software development efficiency and reliability.
